## TTV–Mitigation Associations through Fisher’s Test and Phi Coefficient

### [Download data](CorrMitTTVsMacroCategories.xlsx)

### [Download script](MitigationStrategiesScript.R)

This script computes, through Fisher’s test and Phi Coefficient, the association between the different types of TTVs (internal, external, construct, and conclusion) and the four mitigation categories: Refinement and validation of data collection instruments (C1), Minimization of researcher bias and subjectivity (C2), Management and validation of data repositories/tools (C3), and Control and standardization of the experimental environment (C4).

This analysis supports **Figure 4** in the paper, which visualizes the associations between TTVs and mitigation categories.

⚠️ Ensure the script and the data file are stored in the same directory before execution.

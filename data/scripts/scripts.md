# Scripts

This page contains the R scripts used to generate the figure presented in the paper. The script can be downloaded and run locally in [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). 

For detailed execution instructions,  see [**How to Run the Scripts**](../../README.md#-how-to-run-the-scripts). 

The Figure 4, generated by the script is displayed below for reference.

## TTV–Mitigation Associations through Fisher’s Test and Phi Coefficient

### [Download data](CorrMitTTVsMacroCategories.xlsx)

### [Download script](MitigationStrategiesScript.R)

This script computes, through Fisher’s test and Phi Coefficient, the association between the different types of TTVs (internal, external, construct, and conclusion) and the four mitigation categories: Refinement and validation of data collection instruments (C1), Minimization of researcher bias and subjectivity (C2), Management and validation of data repositories/tools (C3), and Control and standardization of the experimental environment (C4).

This output is linked to the **Figure 4** in the paper and supports part of the statistical analysis.
